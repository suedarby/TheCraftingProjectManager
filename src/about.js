    <p>Every crafter knows the pain of not being able to find something and spending the money on a duplicate even though they “know it’s here somewhere”. To reduce duplication of patterns, notions, fabric and other supplies for sewing & crafts, the Crafting Project Manager was born.</p>
    <p>The focus for this project is as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Projects</li>
    <li>Stash (future)</li>
    <li>Shopping (future)</li>
    <li>Budget (future)</li>
