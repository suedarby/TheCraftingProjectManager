# Crafting Project Manager

This project is the Capstone for Sue Darby, Stacie Wyatt and Devine Sims through Entity Academy/Woz-U. The main app is found in the task-manager-main folder

## Executive Summary

Every crafter knows the pain of not being able to find something and spending the money on a duplicate even though they “know it’s here somewhere”. To reduce duplication of patterns, notions, fabric and other supplies for sewing & crafts, the Crafting Project Manager was born. 

The focus for this project is as follows:

- Projects
- Stash (future)
- Shopping (future)
- Budget (future)
- Dashboard

The functionality is based on a Task-Manager repo by https://github.com/Tammibriggs/Task-manager and is modded to meet the needs of the project.
